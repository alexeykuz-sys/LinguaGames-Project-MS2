1.  **UX Development**

  

**1.1 Project Goals**

  

Language based memory game will help users to learn a new language in the relaxed entertaining way.
  
As a developer and user, I have never enjoyed playing games that do not have a purpose. Therefore, I have decided to create the game that will help users to practice a new language.

The primary goal of the website is to make learning fun and inspire users to return to the game, as they progress.

Playing memory games can improve other brain functions, such as attention, concentration, and focus. Memory games give space to critical thinking and that helps children nurture their attention to detail. Memory games can improve visual recognition.

**Project goal**

The purpose of this project to create website to enable consumers to have fun interactive experience in learning of the new words. The progress will be measured by virtual badges, stars and list of words learn during the session.

The website has to be easy to navigate with clear purpose of the buttons and screen space. The game has to project the clear and safe framework for clients and to make the experience casual rather than requirement.
 

**1.2. UX requirements**

The website targets the individuals interested to learn or improve the knowledge of the foreign languages in the casual way, through the game experience.

**1.3. Users:**

 Individuals interested to learn a new language with no age limitation.


**1.4. User goals:**

1.  To identify application allowing users to learn 300-600 words to be to travel and 1000 words to be able to converse;
2.  To identify application to users s.

  

  

**1.5 Developer's Goals**

The site owner has the following goals:

-   To provide users with interactive and easy navigation learning process.
-   To encourage users to learn more 
- To provide platform with colors and fonts stimulating users experience.

  

**1.6. User Stories**

  

1.  Visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate through the game
2.  As a visitor I want to have a clear rules, how to play.
6.  As a Visitor want an easy way to contact developer.
8.  As a returning visitor to the website, i would like to have a choice of languages to learn or improve


**1.7. Design Choices**

When designing website i took inspiration for colours and fonts from the game Memory. The application is using colours and fonts scientifically proven to help users to learn and stimulate their cognitive functions.


Fonts

I have used Google Fonts to determine the best fonts suitable for each part of the website, I.e. Logo, Menu and Body information.

I opted to use Open Sans font for my website, which is one of the most popular fonts used by major internet companies.

Icons

Icons used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in moderation and are self explanatory.

Colours

The colours were determined by the pallet of Cooler website:

-   For body text and some titles: ???;
-   For navbar and contact modal:
i used linear gradient of 
rgb(5,  57,  97),
and
rgb(10,  105,  177);
-   For body background: rgb(55,  149,  93).

**1.8. Features**

View my wireframes here.
It's one-page website with  a number of modal windows. I used JS to hide windows and information to make sure users are not distracted by excessive information on the page.
I placed only fixed navigation bar  with Logo and menu, linking user to the rules of the game and contact modal, and cards to play with.

Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons

Translation API that translates seamlessly behind the scene  English words into three languages.

Features to implement:
- to add bigger choice of languages;
- to increase number and difficulty of words;
- to create competition board.

**2. Testing**


First time testing. I used an online tool, using ami.responsivedesign.is and [Screenfly](https://bluetree.ai/screenfly/) website to test website on various devices.

I’ve tested the CSS with [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) which told me that there were mistake in different browsers attributes, which I removed.

The HTML I’ve tested with [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) which gave me the good **results:**

JS was tested on [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
  
Responsiveness

-   **Implementation** I tried CSS Grid but eventually opted to use **Bootstrap** and Flexbox throughout the project to ensure **maximum** responsibility. I've tested with **above tools and results was good except for ????.**

Contact form

-   **Implementation** 
-   **Results**
-   **Verdict** Form validation works, so test **passed**.

 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

**3. Bugs and Debugging**



**4. Project Deployment**

I built website using **gitpod** and **GitHub** to host the repository.

To deploy the website using **GitHub Pages** the following steps have to be made:

-   Opened up and log in **GitHub** in the **browser**.
-   Selected my [repositories](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys?tab=repositories).
-   Navigated  and open project to ????
-   In the top navigation clicked **settings**.
-   Scrolled down to the **GitHub Pages** area.
-   Selected **Master Branch** from the **Source** dropdown menu.
-   Clicked to **confirm** my **selection**.

  

**You can run the project locally, in which case you have to follow the following steps:**

  

To clone this project from GitHub:

1. You can paste the repository link directly into any editor you use with the command 'git clone'. For example:

git clone …….
